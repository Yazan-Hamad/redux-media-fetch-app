# Redux data fetching app
This is a simple React and Redux app that fetches data from Json-API by using both plain Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query.
* Plain Redux Toolkit was used for fetching, adding, and deleting users.
* Redux Toolkit Query was used for fetching, adding, and deleting albums and photos.
* Data is randomly generated using [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library.
